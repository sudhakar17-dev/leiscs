                                    all these questions in this article. So, let’s get into it.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Invention of microwave oven</h3>

                                <p>
                                    It may amaze you to learn that the invention of the microwave oven was accidental.
                                    The scientist, Percy Spencer, was performing experiments on adevice called a
                                    magnetron. Magnetrons generate powerful microwave radiation. During this experiment,
                                    he observed that the candy bar in his pocket was completely melted. That's when it
                                    occurred to him to explore the applications of microwaves in cooking food. From this
                                    experiment, It was observed that a high powered travelling microwave has the
                                    capability of heating food. But, of course, this incident raises the question of,
                                    what was in the microwave that melted the candy bar?
                                </p>

                                <h3>What are the microwaves?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Microwaves are electromagnetic waves in a particular spectrum. Like any other
                                    electromagnetic waves, they have oscillating electric and magnetic fields. If you
                                    track amplitude of the wave in a specific area, you can observe this oscillation
                                    (refer fig 1). In the chocolate melting accident case, the oscillating electric
                                    field component of the electromagnetic wave is responsible for cooking the food. Now
                                    let me explain how these oscillating electric fields cook food.
                                </p>
                                <img src="../img/blog/Electronics/Microwave-oven/Oscillating-electric-field.jpg"
                                    class="img-fluid" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig 1 : Electric and magnetic fields of microwave</figcaption>

                                <h3>Role of oscillating electric fields in cooking</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Most of the food that we consume has water in it. Water is a polar molecule. The
                                    hydrogen atoms of the water molecule are placed at an angle of 104 degrees from each
                                    other and both the hydrogen and oxygen atoms have charges (refer fig 2). This makes
                                    the water molecule behave like a dipole. When an electric field is applied to the
                                    water molecule, it starts to rotate due to the torque produced on the dipole. Since
                                    in electromagnetic waves the electric field oscillates continually, the water
                                    molecules will keep on oscillating. Due to this oscillating rotation, the molecules
                                    rub against each other and produce friction and heat in the food.
                                </p>

                                <h3>How to trap microwaves in the oven?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Now let me explain how to convert this heat generation concept into a workable
                                    product. To use the electromagnetic wave's energy efficiently, it must be reused
                                    several times. An efficient way of achieving this is to reflect it and keep it
                                    confined in a particular area. We need a reflector for that. The best way of making
                                    this reflector is with the help of metal. The metallic surface causes the microwave
                                    to reflect from its surface and if you keep one more reflector at the source side
                                    the reflection will keep on continuing (refer fig 3a). This way we will be able to
                                    trap the energy of electromagnetic radiation within a volume.
                                </p>

                                <figcaption>Fig 3a : Reflection of electromagnetic wave</figcaption>

                                <p>However, the most efficient way of trapping electromagnetic wave energy is by use of
                                    a technique called resonance cavity. This method also increases the intensity of
                                    electromagnetic waves. Let’s understand the concept of resonance cavity using a
                                    simplified approach of standing waves.</p>

                                <h3>What is a standing wave? </h3>

                                <p>
                                    A standing wave is a stationary wave that fluctuates in time but does not propagate
                                    in space. Standing wave is different from a normal travelling wave (refer fig 3b).
                                </p>
                                <img src="../img/blog/Electronics/Microwave-oven/Microwave-reflection.jpg"
                                    class="img-fluid" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig 3b : Standing waves</figcaption>

                                <p>
                                    Standing wave is formed when two waves having the same amplitude and the same
                                    frequency, moving in opposite directions, are superimposed on each other. Now let's
                                    assume two electromagnetic waves, which are travelling in the opposite direction.
                                    Let’s see at one instant in fig 4a. You can see that waves are 180 phase
                                    differences. When you add both the electromagnetic waves, they will perfectly
                                    cancel.
                                </p>

                                <img src="../img/blog/Electronics/Microwave-oven/180-degree.jpg" class="img-fluid"
                                    alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig 4a : First instance: 180° phase difference</figcaption>

                                <p>
                                    Now, let's take another instant as shown in fig 4b. The resultant is a bigger
                                    sinusoidal curve. Now take one more instant (refer fig 4c). Here we get an even
                                    bigger sinusoidal wave as the output. By comparing the results of these three
                                    instances, it is clear that the resultant electromagnetic wave just oscillates in
                                    its position without travelling.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now let me explain how to produce two oppositely travelling waves practically. We
                                    will get a clear solution for this if we understand how electromagnetic waves get
                                    reflected on a metal surface. We know that when a wave meets a reflector, it returns
                                    to its source. Can you spot any connection between this reflected and incident wave
                                    in fig 5a? The reflected wave is, in fact, the wave that would have travelled
                                    forward if there were no reflector. First, of course, you have to fold this
                                    imaginary part 180 degrees, as shown in fig 5a. Now let’s add one more reflector,
                                    this time at the side of the source as shown in fig 5b. This will reflect the same
                                    way again and produce a third wave, and this process will repeat.
                                </p>

                                    However, if you keep the second reflector at the intersection point of the first and
                                    second waves, the third wave produced after the reflection will be the same as the
                                    first wave (refer fig 5b). This is a clever arrangement. When you arrange the second
                                    reflector this way, we will see only two waves traveling in opposite directions
                                    instead of many reflected waves and chaos. If you find out the resultant of them, it
                                    will be a standing wave (refer fig 5c).

                                    This is a well known fact. The standing waves are produced when the distance between
                                    the source and reflector is an integer multiple of half wavelength (nλ/2). Thus, the
                                    dimensions of the closed structure are determined by the wavelength of these waves.
                                    Now, a fun fact, just measure the cavity length of the microwave oven in your
                                    kitchen. It will be an integer multiple of this wavelength.

                                    It is clear from fig 5c that some points of the standing wave are at high energy
                                    intensity and some other points are at zero intensity. Due to this, there would be
                                    many spots in a microwave, some cold and others hot.

                                <h3>Microwave oven experiment </h3>

                                <p>
                                    Let's do a simple experiment at home. Using cheese, you can see cold and hot spots
                                    of your kitchen's microwave oven. Just keep the shredded cheese inside your
                                    microwave oven for one minute. After one minute you will see the cheese surface with
                                    a few hot spots. The presence of such hot spots causes a microwave to cook food
                                    unevenly. In short, the cavity resonance technique we used to trap the microwaves
                                    more efficiently has led to creation of cold and hot spots. To overcome this
                                    problem, nowadays, a microwave consists of a rotating plate which helps the food
                                    cook evenly.
                                </p>

                                <h3>How do microwaves generate in an oven? </h3>

                                <p>The component responsible for producing microwaves is known as a magnetron. A
                                    magnetron emits microwaves in all directions (refer fig 7). To know more about the
                                    magnetron, please click here. To confine the wave to propagate in one dimension, the
                                    magnetron is attached to the waveguide. From the waveguide, the waves come into the
                                    cooking chamber to heat food.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Can any electromagnetic wave cook the food?</h3>
                                <p>Another question that has to be answered is whether microwaves are the only
                                    electromagnetic waves capable of heating food or if there are any other waves that
                                    could accomplish the same result? Any electromagnetic waves have the capability to
                                    heat food, but they come with certain limitations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Waves with long wavelengths can easily pass through our food so that they won't be
                                    able to transfer much energy to it. Additionally, to get standing waves, large
                                    devices would be required.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Shorter wavelength waves are absorbed more rapidly on the outer surface of the food,
                                    so they do not penetrate far enough down to cook it evenly. If we want to cook
                                    deeply, we have to switch to a very high power source that would be unfeasible. In
                                    the microwave range, the suitable frequency for all practical purposes and which did
                                    not require a licence was 2.45 GHz.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Are microwave ovens safe? </h3>

                                <p>
                                    The powerful microwaves produced by an oven can be hazardous to humans if we come in
                                    direct contact with them, but don’t worry. The electromagnetic radiation produced by
                                    a microwave oven is always confined within it, it will never leave the chamber. So
                                    there is no point in worrying about the health hazards caused by the electromagnetic
                                    radiation of microwave ovens.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Microwave heating vs convection heating </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Now the most interesting question: why is heating with a microwave oven superior to
                                    conventional heating methods? Since microwaves can penetrate the food, the food is
                                    cooked from the inside as well as the outside. Moreover, It cooks food faster than
                                    other conventional methods. The convection method cooks food from the outside in.
                                    This is because the heat energy has to travel from outside to inside. But this
                                    method can be useful on some occasions. When you need food with a crisp surface and
                                    a soft interior or baking, the convective heating method is preferred. Due to this
                                    reason, modern microwave ovens come with a convection option for baking purposes.
                                </p>
