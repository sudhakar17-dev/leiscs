                                    Be it Burj Khalifa, the pentagon or your house, the weight of these structures is
                                    ultimately borne by a structural element called footing. A design mistake in the
                                    footing can result in the collapse of the whole building, which is why a proper
                                    foundation design is crucial. In this article I will explain you the importance of
                                    footings and its different types.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Footings are the most important part of the foundation. Their job is to distribute
                                    the heavy load of the building, concentrated on the columns, to the wider surface
                                    area of soil to achieve structural stability.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Things to consider while designing a footing</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In my opinion, before understanding the types of footing, first we have to
                                    understand some design aspects of footing.
                                </p>

                                <h5>1. Soil</h5>
                                <p>
                                    More specifically, engineers should analyse whether or not the soil at a particular
                                    location is capable of bearing a calculated amount of load. If the soil is
                                    compressible under loading, excavation is done until and unless you find the
                                    incompressible layer which can stand the loading. This layer of soil, in the physics
                                    of civil engineering, is called hard strata as shown in fig 1. On this hard strata
                                    we can add columns to transfer the load and cover the pit with soil.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    More the weight of the building, the wider the footing should be. As a result of
                                    frictional resistance between the footing and the soil, if this structure is
                                    subjected to lateral forces like winds, floods, etc. Footings will help your
                                    building avoid sliding (refer fig 2).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The footing has to withstand pressure applied by the soil as well. If the footing’s
                                    thickness is inadequate, the footing on either side of the column will bend due to
                                    the soil applying uplift pressure on it. This effect is called ‘Applied bending
                                    moment’. You can see this effect in this FEA result here (refer fig 3a).
                                </p>

                                    To prevent this result, the thickness of the plate is increased (refer fig 3b).

                                <h3>Different types of footing</h3>

                                <h5>1. Pad or isolated footing</h5>

                                <p>
                                    With this process, the soil should be able to bear the entire structural load quite
                                    easily. However, this concentrated load on the columns will cause excessive stress
                                    in the soil due to lesser contact area. What do you think will happen if this stress
                                    exceeds the soil's bearing capacity? it will undergo the punching effect, which
                                    leads to imbalance in your structure and eventually cracks or even failure of the
                                    whole building. To avoid these failures, you can increase the contact area between
                                    the soil and columns. This increased contact area reduces the stress on the soil,
                                    and the building stands strong (refer fig 4). This type of pad, or isolated footing,
                                    is employed to support lightweight houses that rest on soil with medium strength.
                                </p>

                                <figcaption>Fig 4 : Increased contact area reduces the stress on the soil</figcaption>

                                <h5>2. Trapezoidal footing </h5>

                                <p>
                                    The Isolated footing design can be further optimised economically. If you observe
                                    the pressure applied from the soil, it is uniform. However, applied bending moment
                                    increases, as you come to the centre zone of the footing. Thus, the need for footing
                                    thickness in the centre is greater than at the edges. Therefore, a Trapezoidal
                                    footing shape has been adopted in modern structures for isolated footings (refer fig
                                    5).
                                </p>

                                <h5>3. Eccentric footing</h5>

                                <p>
                                    A Pad type footing is used in more complex types of footings. Suppose your
                                    building’s columns stand exactly on the edge of the property line, obviously your
                                    neighbours won’t allow you to take up extra space simply to extend the footing. In
                                    such a case, the column is placed on the edge of the footing, causing all loading
                                    transfer on the soil to become unbalanced or eccentric (refer fig 6). This footing
                                    can carry a considerable amount of load on the structure. However, if the load
                                    increases beyond a certain limit, the structure may fail.
                                </p>

                                <h5>4. Strap footing and combined footing</h5>

                                <p>
                                    The trick to solve the problem of Eccentric footing is by transferring the excess
                                    loading into another adjacent footing with good strength. This transfer is
                                    accomplished by placing a connecting beam in between, which acts as a strap. One of
                                    the columns in this strap footing (refer fig 7a) will generally have an eccentric
                                    footing.
                                </p>

                                    Moreover, in some cases when the columns are too close to each other, engineers
                                    purposely combine the footing i.e Combined footing (refer fig 7b).

                                <p>
                                    In most of the modern heavy buildings and the structures, columns are provided with
                                    combined footing as a whole. A single reinforced concrete slab is made for each and
                                    every column. These footings are called ‘raft’ or ‘mat’ types (refer fig 8). They
                                    spread the load evenly imposed by a number of columns or walls on the soil. This
                                    type of footing is adopted to avoid deep foundations which would otherwise go around
                                    60 to 200 feet deep. In an area with expansive soil, the raft foundation is a boon
                                    that lessens the chances of differential settlement. The Burj Khalifa uses a
                                    combination of raft foundation and piles, which forms a shallow and deep foundation.
